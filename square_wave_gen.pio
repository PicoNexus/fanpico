; Adjustable Square Wave generator that reads 'period' from FIFO.
;
; Side-set pin 0 is used for output

.program square_wave_gen
.side_set 1 opt

start:
    pull noblock    side 0 ; Read FIFO to OSR (or copy copy X to OSR if FIFO empty)
    mov x, osr             ; Save 'period' in X
    mov y, x               ; Copy X to Y
    jmp !y start	   ; Steady low output if period is 0
hi_loop:
    nop
    jmp y-- hi_loop        ; Loop until Y hits 0
    mov y, x        side 1 ; Reset Y back to X and set output low
    nop             [3]    ; Wait 3 cycle to keep both sides same length
lo_loop:
    nop
    jmp y-- lo_loop        ; Loop until Y hits 0
